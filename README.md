# Strati
  
**Strati** (which is the Italian for "Layers") is an Android app built with Jetpack Compose that presents thought-provoking philosophical and social questions. The questions become progressively more challenging, guiding users through increasingly deeper layers of reflection and conversation.

## Main Features

- **Navigation between Topics and Layers:** select a topic and then a layer to start the question session.
- **Multilanguage support:** easily switch between Italian and English with a simple language toggle.
